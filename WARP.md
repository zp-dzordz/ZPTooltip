# WARP.md - AI Development Worktree

This file tracks AI-assisted experimental development for ZPTooltip.

## Current Focus: AI-Agentic Development

This worktree (`ai-development` branch) is dedicated to:
- AI-assisted rapid prototyping
- Experimental features and improvements
- Code exploration and refactoring
- Performance optimizations

## AI Development Log

### Session: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: Set up dual worktree for AI development
- **Status**: ✅ Worktree created, tests pass, ready for AI experiments
- **Build Status**: ✅ All tests passing on iOS 18.6 simulator
- **Next**: Implement first AI-assisted improvement

### First AI Experiment: Performance & Code Quality
- **Target**: Remove redundant GeometryProxy Sendable conformance warning
- **Issue**: Line 88 in TooltipHelper.swift has redundant Sendable conformance
- **Approach**: Clean up and potentially optimize coordinate space handling

## Experimental Ideas to Explore

### 1. Performance Optimizations
- Analyze gesture handling performance
- Optimize coordinate space calculations
- Reduce preference key updates

### 2. Feature Enhancements
- Enhanced haptic feedback patterns
- More tooltip positioning options
- Accessibility improvements
- Animation customization options

### 3. Code Architecture
- Simplify state management
- Better separation of concerns
- Platform abstraction improvements
- Testing infrastructure enhancements

### 4. Developer Experience
- Better debug information
- Improved documentation
- Example apps and demos
- Performance monitoring tools

## Sync Notes
- Main branch: Production-ready code only
- AI branch: Experimental, requires review before merge
- Use `git merge main` to sync latest stable changes
- Push experimental changes to `ai-development` branch for review
